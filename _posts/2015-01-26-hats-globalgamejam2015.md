Had such a blast at the Global Game Jam 2015 @ Northeastern University as part of Team Boulder (alongside Matt Long, Nicole Amidon, Walton Lee, Nathan Low, Sarah Zaidan, Rui Jiang). We developed a 2D side-scrolling platformer in Unity called “Hats?“.

The theme of the jam was “What do we do now?”, so we decided on a game where the abilities of the character depend on the hats which you have on your head. There is one hat for moving left, right, jumping and swimming. So there are levels where you are limited to go only to the right, only to the left, only jump and go left, etc.

You can [download](http://globalgamejam.org/2015/games/hats) the game from the Global Game Jam website.
